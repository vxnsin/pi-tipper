# PI Tipper

**PI Tipper** is a completely **useless** project where you type digits of PI (3.14159…) until you make a mistake. The game ends when you type the wrong digit. No real purpose, just digits. But it's fun in its own weird way!

## How It Works

- The game will show the digits of PI one by one.
- You have to type them correctly to keep going.
- Type the wrong digit, and the game ends. Simple!

## Features

- Colorful output with digits of PI.
- A fun (and pointless) way to test how many digits of PI you can remember.
- Easy to play. Easy to lose.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vensin/pi-tipper.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd pi-tipper
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Run the game:

    ```bash
    node pi.js
    ```

## Why?

Because sometimes, doing something totally unnecessary is the most fun. Who needs practical projects when you can type PI?
